# QBASIC Programs
Surviving remnants of some old QBASIC programs I had written when the world was younger and my mind was more immature and juvenile. They are basically useless but serve as a relic of the past to showcase how things used to be back in 2014 when I first began my programming journey. (I later found these much later and decided to upload them on GitHub to keep the nostalgia alive.)
